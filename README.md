them more accessible and easier to analyze.
There are four key steps for data wrangling collect data, cleaning data, transform data,
explore data.
By using Pandas library i have done the data wranglling project.In that i have use different operations 
like grouping data, merging data, concatenating data for the purpose of analysing or getting them 
ready to be used with another set of data. 
Python has built-in features to apply these wrangling methods to various data sets to achieve the analytical goal.
